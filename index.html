    My name is __Himanshu Goyal__ ([<span style="color:red">How to pronounce my name</span>](./assets/name.mp3)). I am a Dual Degree Student at [Indian Institute of Technology Bhubaneswar](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/) majoring in Computer Science. 
    Currently, I am focussing on building large scale decentralized IoT/WSNs systems which embodies Trust, Security and Privacy guarantees. I am being advised by [Dr. Sudipta Saha](https://www.iitbbs.ac.in/profile-print.php?furl=sudipt). 
    I am also closely associated with [Decentralized and Smart Systems Research Group (DSSRG)](https://sites.google.com/iitbbs.ac.in/dssrg) at IIT Bhubaneswar.

    In the past, I've spent some excellent summers at [TCS Research and Innovation](https://www.tcs.com/research-and-innovation) (Summer 2020), and  at [CNERG IIT Kharagpur](https://cnerg-iitkgp.github.io/) (Summer 2019). 
   
    I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems & Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML).

<p class="message">A group of distrusting parties wish to compute a function on their private data sets. The parties should learn the output of the function but no additional information about the data sets themselves without using a trusted third party.</p>

<p>Below is a collection of my recent blog posts and publications.</p>

<p>I began my career in cryptography at Oregon State University in 2015 with the goal of advancing the field of cryptography to meet real world constraints. Most notably is the notion of being able to compute on encrypted data and the area of research known as Secure Computation:</p>
<p>A group of distrusting parties wish to compute a function on their private data sets. The parties should learn the output of the function but no additional information about the data sets themselves.</p>

<p>The potential of this technology captured my imagination in 2014 during the completion of my undergraduate in Computer Science at Oregon State University. Since then I have worked on several projects in this area. Most notably has been the development of a highly optimized protocol for performing Secure Computation and advances in Private Set Intersection for both malicious and semi-honest adversaries.</p>

<p>I view my research as part of the solution to our most challenging privacy issues. In particular, when strong privacy concerns inhibit the utility of data, e.g. medical data. I am interested in overcoming this tradeoff.</p>

<p>Prior to Visa Research I was an intern and research consultant at Microsoft Research where I worked on projects involving fully homomorphic encryption and secure computation more broadly. Eariler in my career I also worked at Boeing & Digimarc doing software engineering.</p> -->

        <p>I have worked on several disciplines ranging from Deep learning, Systems & Networking, Blockchain, Trustworthy distributed computing and Privacy Preserving Machine Learning(PPML). Verily, I truly enjoy applied cryptography in particular.</p>
        <p>I maintain a list of cryptographic resources under the <a href="{{ site.url }}/crypto_resources">Crypto Resources</a> tab. It mostly contains references to the courses taught at universities along with some additional useful information. If you feel to contribute, I welcome you to contact me for the same. I also occasionally <a href="{{ site.url }}/archive">blog</a> to distill out my understanding from the readings I do. Well, you can find me reading, lurking reddit and twitter in my spare time. Nevertheless, I am an ardent Cricket fan and love talking about it.</p>
