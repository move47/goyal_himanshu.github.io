<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:85%;"><b>Abstract:</b> In the modern digital world, a user of a smart system remains surrounded with as well as observed by a number of tiny IoT devices round the clock almost everywhere. Unfortunately, the ability of these devices to sense and share various physical parameters, although play a key role in these smart systems but also causes the threat of breach of the privacy of the users. Existing solutions for privacy-preserving computation for decentralized systems either use too complex cryptographic techniques or exploit an extremely high degree of message passing and hence, are not suitable for the resource-constrained IoT devices that constitute a significant fraction of a smart system. In this work, we propose a novel lightweight strategy LiPI for Privacy-Preserving Data Aggregation in low-power IoT systems. The design of the strategy is based on decentralized and collaborative data obfuscation and does not exploit any dependency on any trusted third party. In addition, besides minimizing the communication requirements, we make appropriate use of the recent advances in Synchronous-Transmission (ST)-based protocols in our design to accomplish the goal efficiently. Extensive evaluation based on comprehensive experiments in both simulation platforms and publicly available WSN/IoT testbeds demonstrates that our strategy works up to at least 51.7% faster and consumes 50.5% lesser energy compared to the existing state-of-the-art strategies.

      <li> <i> What are major strengths? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> This paper proposes a framework ReLI to efficiently achieve Byzantine Consensus in Low-Power IoT-Systems. </li>
        <li> The proposed scheme leverages Synchrous Transmission (ST) based communication mechanism among IoT devices. </li>
        <li> The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated by implementations in Cooja as well as IoT/WSN testbeds DCube and FlockLab composed of 45 and 24 TelosB motes, where the algorithms were implemented in Contiki OS for TelosB motes. </li>
        <li>   The paper shows that ReLI can operate up to 80% faster and consume up to 78% less radio-on time compared to the traditional implementation of the strategy in a publicly available IoT/WSN testbed containing 45 nodes. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> <i> What are shortcomings? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> The performance analysis was done for relatively small number of IoT nodes, just up to 45 nodes.
             Analysis on scalability is required with increased IoT nodes. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>

  <li> <b>Review 3:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> What are major strengths? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> This paper proposes a framework named ReLI to achieve Byzantine consensus in low-power IoT systems.
             Its performance is well demonstrated by implementation.   </li>
      </ul>
      <li> <i> What are shortcomings? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Readability is low because of paper organization.
             For example, although Fig. 1 appears in p.5 (Section IV), it is referred in p.3 (Section III).    </li>
      </ul>
