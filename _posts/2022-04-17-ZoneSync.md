<p style="text-align: justify; font-size:85%;"><b>Abstract:</b> With the advancement in hardware technology, IoT-edge systems are getting well-equipped with a variety of types of sensing devices. The massive decentralized sensing capability of IoT-edge can be used not only for monitoring purposes but also for automated detection and even prediction of anomalous behavior in the area covered by the IoT-edge. However, as a prerequisite to anomaly detection, what is very essential is a clear understanding of the usual nature of the region where the IoT -edge system is deployed. The existing solutions in this direction mostly take the help of the cloud to serve the purpose. We endeavor to carry out the task of understanding the characteristics of the zones/regions in the edge itself through in-network distributed computing. In this work, we derive a simple lightweight strategy based on Synchronous-Transmission to enable every node in an IoT-edge to gain knowledge about the zone it belongs to and identify its surrounding zones in real-time. Through extensive simulation and testbed-based study, we show that our proposed solution can accomplish the goals quite accurately and up to 12.5 times faster than the traditional strategy.</p>

  <li> <b>Review 2:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> What are major strengths? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> This paper proposes a framework ReLI to efficiently achieve Byzantine Consensus in Low-Power IoT-Systems. </li>
        <li> The proposed scheme leverages Synchrous Transmission (ST) based communication mechanism among IoT devices. </li>
        <li> The performance of the proposed scheme was evaluated by implementations in Cooja as well as IoT/WSN testbeds DCube and FlockLab composed of 45 and 24 TelosB motes, where the algorithms were implemented in Contiki OS for TelosB motes. </li>
        <li>   The paper shows that ReLI can operate up to 80% faster and consume up to 78% less radio-on time compared to the traditional implementation of the strategy in a publicly available IoT/WSN testbed containing 45 nodes. </li>
      </ul>
      <li> <i> What are shortcomings? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> The performance analysis was done for relatively small number of IoT nodes, just up to 45 nodes.
             Analysis on scalability is required with increased IoT nodes. </li>
      </ul>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> <b>Review 3:</b>
    <ul>
      <li> <i> What are major strengths? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> This paper proposes a framework named ReLI to achieve Byzantine consensus in low-power IoT systems.
             Its performance is well demonstrated by implementation.   </li>
      </ul>
      <li> <i> What are shortcomings? </i> </li>
      <ul>
        <li> Readability is low because of paper organization.
             For example, although Fig. 1 appears in p.5 (Section IV), it is referred in p.3 (Section III).    </li>
