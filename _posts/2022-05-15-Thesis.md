In this work, we conceptualize an Internet of Things (IoT) system as a vast network of
low-power devices distributed over a large geographical area. Each device is capable of performing tasks,
communicating with other devices, and operates under limited energy resources. We also take into account
the possibility of some devices being manipulated by adversaries with intentions to gain control over the network or to cause the network to deviate from its intended function. The primary
limitation of an IoT system is the resource constraints of the devices. However, we interpret the extensive number of devices in IoT as an advantage. We consider it as a highly distributed system and propose to offset the resource limitation in the devices with collaborative computing, where device-to-device communication is crucial. To effectively leverage the potential of such a large-scale network, we propose a shift from the traditional asynchronous transmission-based communication strategies to time-slotted parallel communication strategies. The primary focus of this research is to achieve Byzantine fault tolerance in IoT networks and to implement privacy-preserving data-aggregation among the participating nodes using the developed synchronous communication strategies.

Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything except the intersection. We use fully homomorphic encryption to construct a fast PSI protocol with a small communication overhead that works particularly well when one of the two sets is much smaller than the other, and is secure against semi-honest adversaries.

The most computationally efficient PSI protocols have been constructed using tools such as hash functions and oblivious transfer, but a potential limitation with these approaches is the communication complexity, which scales linearly with the size of the larger set. This is of particular concern when performing PSI between a constrained device (cellphone) holding a small set, and a large service provider (e.g. _WhatsApp_), such as in the Private Contact Discovery application.
Our running-time-optimized benchmarks show that it takes 36 seconds of online-computation, 71 seconds of non-interactive (receiver-independent) pre-processing, and only 12.5MB of round trip communication to intersect five thousand 32-bit strings with 16 million 32-bit strings. Compared to prior works, this is roughly a 38--115Ã— reduction in communication with minimal difference in computational overhead.
