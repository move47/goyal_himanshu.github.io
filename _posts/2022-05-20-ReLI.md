  <b>Abstract:</b> <p style="text-align: justify;font-size:85%;"> IoT/WSN assisted smart-systems are making our living easier and more comfortable in various aspects. However, there is always a chance of malfunctioning in such massive decentralized systems in crucial moments because of one or more components of the system getting compromised. For instance, monitoring systems installed to watch the status of a bridge may unknowingly suppress the recent deterioration in the status because of some compromised sensing devices. Byzantine fault tolerance support is highly essential in combating the presence of such smart devices with malicious intentions. However, existing solutions for consensus or data aggregation in IoT/WSN systems either assume non-Byzantine node failures or use only simulation/theoretical models to address the existence of Byzantine nodes. Theoretically, a decentralized system can effectively tolerate Byzantine characteristics of up to a certain fraction of the nodes. However, to achieve even that, the nodes need to interact extensively and share data with each other which makes it challenging for such solutions to get practically realized and produce outcomes in real-time, especially in resource-constrained IoT systems. In this work, we adopt Synchronous-Transmission based mechanisms and propose a framework ReLI to efficiently achieve Byzantine consensus in low-power IoT systems. We show that ReLI can operate up to 80% faster and consume up to 78% lesser radio-on time compared to the traditional implementation of the strategy in a publicly available IoT/WSN testbed containing 45 nodes.</p>

  <b>Reviewer comment:</b> I found the combination of declarative language for document extraction, program inference to bootstrap program generation, and UI to help users debug and correct the inferred program very interesting. Combined with the detailed error analysis of the proposed approach and LayoutLM it has the potential to lead to many interesting discussions during the conference on rule-based vs deep learning approaches, their respective benefits in industrial settings, and their potential linking points. -->

Private Set Intersection (PSI) is a cryptographic technique that allows two parties to compute the intersection of their sets without revealing anything except the intersection. We use fully homomorphic encryption to construct a fast PSI protocol with a small communication overhead that works particularly well when one of the two sets is much smaller than the other, and is secure against semi-honest adversaries.

<!--
The most computationally efficient PSI protocols have been constructed using tools such as hash functions and oblivious transfer, but a potential limitation with these approaches is the communication complexity, which scales linearly with the size of the larger set. This is of particular concern when performing PSI between a constrained device (cellphone) holding a small set, and a large service provider (e.g. _WhatsApp_), such as in the Private Contact Discovery application.
Our running-time-optimized benchmarks show that it takes 36 seconds of online-computation, 71 seconds of non-interactive (receiver-independent) pre-processing, and only 12.5MB of round trip communication to intersect five thousand 32-bit strings with 16 million 32-bit strings. Compared to prior works, this is roughly a 38--115Ã— reduction in communication with minimal difference in computational overhead.
