Motivation: Industrial control systems (ICS) are used to automate and
monitor processes and equipment in various industries, such
as energy, transportation, and manufacturing. These systems
provide many benefits, but they can also be vulnerable to se-
curity threats if not properly protected. Most ICS networks
use protocols designed for controlled environments and do
not have built-in security mechanisms. However, the increas-
ing connectivity of ICS devices to networks and the internet
creates opportunities for malicious actors to cause disruptions
and malfunctions. In this study, we employed an empirical
methodology to assess the potential vulnerabilities in existing
ICS networks. Using network scanning techniques, we identi-
fied vulnerable ICS devices according to the Purdue model,
which considers the hierarchical structure of ICS networks
and the different services that devices run on. Our evaluation
showed that this method could effectively identify high-risk
devices and prioritize them for security measures.
